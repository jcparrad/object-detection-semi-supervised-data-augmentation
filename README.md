# object-detection-semi-supervised-data-augmentation

The aim of this project is to implement a semi supervised data augmentacion based on the object detection of google. 
Once a good enough model has been trained, then this model is used for getting more data for the training of the model.
This model will detect objects of interest which will be labeled (based on the VOC format in a xml file).

This proyect  in the future should implement metrics for performance evaluation.
